# ubuntu-20-questions

A list of questions that come to mind as I muddle my way through a fresh Ubuntu installation as a seasoned Mac user.  And hopefully, eventually, their answers.

Mostly for my own reference/tracking, but others are welcome to comment.

Hardware: Dell XPS 15 7590, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD

Software: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
